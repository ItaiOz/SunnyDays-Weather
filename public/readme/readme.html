<h2>Execution</h2>
<p>The submission is a WebStorm project that can be run directly from the IDE.</p>

<h2>Assumptions</h2>
<p>The site use bootstrap CDN therefore assumes an internet connection is available.</p>
<p>The program is using nre methods that we have learned in last classes.</p>
<p>We are communicating with server which is our local host, routing between pages and practicing methods.</p>
<p>I created a register, login and password pages which we navigate between them until we are inside the weather website</p>
<p>When we are in the website after we logged in we are using get, post and delete method to update the list</p>
<p>Most of the validation happens on server side. When I am modifying the table it is done by the server</p>
<p>and the client is getting back a response. Therefore, in every request that is sent I am resetting the data</p>
<p>on client side abd getting response from server and editing the locations list.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The navbar on the top of the home page allows us to navigate to different pages:</p>
<p>Clicking on the big O-W button will just show us the logo of the website</p>
<p>Clicking on Home button will actually guide us back the weather page since we want to avoid collisions</p>
<p>Sign out will leave to login page, and while we are there we will turn the login flag off so we will have</p>
<p>to login again. The readme file leads here :)</p>
